# 👋 Hi, I'm The Disciplined Coder

I don’t rely on motivation. I rely on **discipline**.

🎯 I’m on a mission to become a full-stack developer — from fundamentals to deployment.  
💻 Currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM, Fetch API)  
🛠️ Building projects with real, clean code — no shortcuts  
🚀 Projects coming soon — check back often

> _Discipline over motivation. Every day._
